Food subsidies can have profound impacts on animal health, behavior, and species interactions, although these impacts are not always beneficial, especially when they alter disease transmission. I will investigate how host-parasite dynamics are mediated by variation in individual behavior (e.g., aggressiveness) and community composition (e.g., rate of interspecific contact), along a gradient of human-provided food. I will explore these dynamics in urban populations of American white ibis (\textit{Eudocimus albus}) in South Florida that are habituated to taking human-provided food and host a variety of pathogens. Within species, I will test whether greater supplemental feeding at parks will increase ibis flock sizes and contact rates, and alter the behavior of ibis. At the community level, I will test whether sites with greater supplemental feeding have a higher proportion of non-native and domesticated species and more interspecific contact. Lastly, I will build two mathematical models incorporating data collected in the field studies to explore how i) individual variation in behavior and ii) community composition affect disease dynamics.

Given that insects are important vectors of disease, a growing body of research has focused on the effects of temperature on insect-pathogen interactions. While much of the work so far has emphasized how temperature alters individual host or parasite traits (e.g. immune response or growth), contemporary climate change intensifies the need to quantify how these within-host processes scale up to influence local transmission and regional infection patterns. Monarch butterflies (\textit{Danaus plexippus}) and their protozoan parasite \textit{Ophryocystis elektroscirrha} (OE) are an apt system for studying temperature-dependent infection dynamics at multiple scales. Their iconic migration allows them to recolonize the North American continent in successive generations. This migration is thought to reduce infection prevalence via culling of infected individuals and escape from OE-contaminated breeding sites. Temperature shifts that influence the distribution of monarchs and timing of migration could affect the efficacy of these parasite reduction mechanisms. My specific goals are to (1) quantify thermal responses of host competence, (2) examine the temperature dependence of local parasite transmission, and (3) use this information to predict regional infection patterns. We will develop a stage-specific compartment model that uses empirically-informed functional relationships between temperature, transmission parameters and demographic rates to simulate seasonal infection dynamics in the eastern US, enabling us to predict where OE infection risk will increase or decrease under different warming scenarios._",Rapid (5 minutes),Proposed,Empircal;Theoretical;Conservation;Disease;,Schedule my presentation,Friday AM;,Done;,,,11/25/18 11:05,11/25/18 13:11,ess45140@uga.edu,Edward Stowe,Edward Stowe,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;River Basin Center, University of Georgia;",Seth Wenger,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;River Basin Center, University of Georgia;",Mary Freeman,"Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, U.S. Geological Survey;",Bud Freeman,"Georgia Museum of Natural History, University of Georgia;",,,,,,,,,Rangewide Declines in Amber Darter \textit{Percina antesella} Identified with Multivariate Analysis,"Federally protected species in the U.S. require periodic assessments of extinction risk, which is typically evaluated based on the demographics and distinctiveness of each separate population, as well as the overall number and location of populations. Such assessments do not typically examine the extent to which stochastic fluctuations are independent between populations: this may be important, because overall extinction risk is expected to increase when populations fluctuate synchronously. Multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) modeling can be used to estimate non-independence in population fluctuations across multiple populations, while also estimating parameters associated with population viability, such as long-term growth rate. Using sampling data from 16 shoal sites in north Georgia from 1996-2017, we used MARSS models and AIC-based model selection to assess the status of the Federally Endangered Amber Darter \textit{Percina antesella} within its known populations in the Conasauga and Etowah rivers. The abundance of Amber Darters has declined substantially over the last two decades in the study area, although at differential rates: approximately 12% annually in the Conasauga and 9% in the Etowah. However, annual population fluctuations between the rivers were correlated, suggesting that the two populations experience similar annual environmental variation. Ultimately this analysis indicates the extent to which both of the known Amber Darter populations are imperiled, and that the risk of extinction may be compounded by non-independent population fluctuations. This analysis also demonstrates the utility of MARSS modeling for assessing extinction risk.",Standard (12 minutes),In progress,Applied;Population;Aquatic;Conservation;,Schedule my presentation,,Done;,,,11/26/18 12:17,11/26/18 12:26,mmt13221@uga.edu,Megan Tomamichel,Megan Tomamichel,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia;",Jeb Byers,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;",Richard Hall,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases, University of Georgia;",Marc Frischer,UGA Marine Sciences;,,,,,,,,,Black Gill in Georgiaês Food Shrimp: A Mysterious Threat to the Shrimping Industry,"Black gill disease in food shrimp (\textit{Litopenaseus setiferus} and \textit{Farfantepenaeus aztecus}) has been implicated in the significant decline of the Georgia shrimping industry. The disease is caused by the shrimpês innate immune response to infestation by an unknown species of ciliate. The immune response encysts the ciliate on the shrimpês gills resulting in melanized nodules that reduce the shrimpês ability to process oxygen. As a consequence, the shrimp suffer increased mortality due to oxygen stress and increased predation because of their reduced capacity to escape. _Causes of the recent rise in black gill prevalence are unknown, however there appears to be strong seasonal and temperature components to infection rates. Infection first appears in August, and prevalence increases through the early fall until dissipating in January with the cooling water temperatures. Additionally, food shrimp appear to contract the infection while migrating into the estuary to mature, rather than transporting the infection with them from the open ocean. My research will focus on answering some of the many questions surrounding this important parasite, including refining our understanding of the temperature dependence of transmission, uncovering if there is a –reservoir host” for the parasite, developing models for evaluating mitigation methods to protect Georgiaês shrimping industry, and understanding what ecological impacts the sudden loss of food shrimp has on the estuary._",Standard (12 minutes),Proposed,Ecosystem;Community;Population;Aquatic;Nutrient cycling;Disease;,Keep me on standby,Friday AM;,Done;,,I am also happy to do a rapid presentation if needed.,11/26/18 14:25,11/26/18 14:48,emb19132@uga.edu,Emily Bertucci,Emily Bertucci,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",Benjamin Parrott,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",,,,,,,,,,,,,Effects of environmental stressors on aging trajectories in medaka,"Age specific patterning of DNA methylation (–epigenetic aging”) is the single best marker of biological age as it is strongly correlated with chronological age, the onset of age-related disease, and all-cause mortality. Discrepancies between chronological and biological age can be used to explore the molecular underpinnings that determine different aging trajectories. Previous research in humans demonstrates that adverse environmental conditions are associated with accelerated epigenetic aging, but it is not clear if some life stages are more sensitive to shifts in epigenetic aging trajectories than others. Additionally, the relationship between epigenetic age acceleration due to environmental stressors and the response of the stress axis (i.e. elevation of cortisol) has not been described. We aim to describe the relative contributions of early and late life stress on epigenetic age acceleration and to further examine the relationship between environmental stressors, epigenetic aging, and cortisol. To do this we will expose medaka (\textit{Oryzias latipes}) to a ubiquitous environmental stressor, methylmercury, or exogenous cortisol during early development (0 to 20 days post fertilization (dpf)) or as adults (120 to 140 dpf). After exposures, fish will be reared to six months at which time they will be assessed for age acceleration through several measures of biological age _ epigenetic age, telomere length, and regenerative capacity.

Temperature is a strong driver of vector-borne disease transmission, and characterizing the thermal range and optimum for transmission is crucial for accurately predicting arbovirus emergence and spread. To address the lack of data on the relationship between temperature and key pathogen traits for emerging arboviruses, we conducted a series of experiments to estimate the thermal performance of Zika virus (ZIKV) in field-derived \textit{Aedes aegypti} across eight constant temperatures. We observed strong, unimodal effects of temperature on vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival. We used thermal responses of these traits to update an existing temperature-dependent R0 (the basic reproductive number) model, to infer how temperature impacts ZIKV transmission. We demonstrated that ZIKV transmission is optimized at a mean temperature of approximately 29C, and has a thermal range of 22.7C to 34.7C. The predicted thermal minimum for Zika transmission is 5C warmer than for dengue virus which suggests that current estimates on the global environmental suitability for Zika transmission are over-predicting its possible range. Accurately characterizing the unimodal effect of temperature on emerging arboviruses, like ZIKV, is critical for estimating the potential geographic and seasonal range for transmission, and accurately predicting where future climate change will increase, decrease, or have minimal impact on transmission.",Standard (12 minutes),Completed,Disease;,Keep me on standby,,Done;,,,11/27/18 15:08,11/27/18 17:42,jlz38924@uga.edu,Julie Ziemba,Julie Ziemba,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",Stacey Lance,"Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",Krista Capps,"Center for Integrative Conservation Research;Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;River Basin Center, University of Georgia;",,,,,,,,,,,Sublethal Stressors in a Complex Life Cycle,"Amphibians with complex life cycles undergo periods of energy-demanding tissue reorganization and ecological niche shifts that expose them to combinations of anthropogenic stressors in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For vertebrates, chronic exposure to stressors generally causes elevated glucocorticoid production, which can alter growth, development, and immune function. However, much of what we know about stressors and immune function in amphibians comes from experiments that either artificially elevate glucocorticoids by applying exogenous corticosterone to subjects, or do not directly measure corticosterone production despite exposing amphibians to ecologically-relevant stressors. Further, these studies do not consider how ontogeny may mediate stress, and are typically limited to observing effects of a stressor at only one or two life stages of a single generation. We are proposing a long-term laboratory study using invasive Cuban tree frogs (textit{Osteopilus septentrionalis}) and ranavirus as a model system to: 1) investigate the sublethal effects of two common stressors (heavy metals and organic contaminants) in amphibian habitats, 2) evaluate chronic corticosterone elevation as a potential mechanism for immunosuppression and variation in disease exposure outcomes, 3) elucidate acute effects of stressors experienced at different life stages, and 4) the long-term cumulative effects of stressors throughout development and 5) across generations. We predict that chronic corticosterone elevation due to pre- and post-metamorphic contaminant exposure will reduce immune defense (lower plasma microbicidal activity) and increase ranavirus susceptibility (higher viral load) and viral shedding rates of individuals.

As temperature increases, the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) predicts that leaf litter breakdown rate should increase with an activation energy of 0.6-0.7 eV. However, the relative responses of microorganisms and leaf-shredding aquatic insects (shredders) to warming temperatures may deviate from MTE predictions and affect the relative proportions of terrestrially-derived carbon that are lost as CO2, integrated into the food web, and transported downstream. We conducted two-month leaf litter incubations in streams across a temperature gradient at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (NC, USA) between September 2017 and October 2018. We compared litter breakdown rates between coarse and fine mesh litterbags containing either \textit{Rhododendron maximum} or \textit{Acer rubrum} leaves and quantified the relative contributions of shredders and microorganisms to leaf litter breakdown for both litter types across temperatures. Across a seasonal temperature gradient, microbial contributions to breakdown increased with increasing temperature, although the slope of this relationship differed from MTE predictions. Shredder contributions were highest during the coldest months of the year. This pattern is opposite of what is predicted by MTE and is most likely driven by seasonal shredder community dynamics. Shredder physiology, community structure, and life history are all important factors that may dictate the response of litter breakdown to increased temperature across seasonal and spatial temperature gradients.",Standard (12 minutes),In progress,Applied;Empircal;Ecosystem;Aquatic;,Schedule my presentation,,Done;,,,11/27/18 14:22,11/27/18 20:12,sb61937@uga.edu,Samantha Bock,Samantha Bock,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",Benjamin Parrott,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",,,,,,,,,,,,,Linking proximate mechanisms of developmental plasticity to environmental variation in nature,"Interactions between organisms and their environment during development can exert lasting influences on phenotypic expression later in life. One of the starkest examples of this phenomenon, termed developmental plasticity, is temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Occurring in a range of taxa, including all crocodilians, TSD provides a unique window through which to examine how external stimuli are integrated into physiological responses that shape phenotypic diversity in terms of both inter- and intra-sexual variation. However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying TSD has historically been shaped by experimental studies employing constant incubation temperatures that do not reflect the variability of environments experienced in nature. In order to understand the scope of thermal variation experienced during development by the American alligator, this project uses field data to characterize the thermal dynamics of 70 alligator nests monitored over seven years at two geographically distinct sites. Examination of the ecological drivers of nest temperature variation revealed that both ambient environmental conditions and local habitat factors shape the thermal environment experienced by alligator embryos. Interestingly, in a majority of nests, alligator embryos experience both male- and female-promoting temperatures, sometimes within a daily cycle. To assess how these opposing environmental signals are translated into sexually dimorphic developmental signaling cascades across fine temporal scales, we employed empirically derived thermal fluctuations in laboratory investigations. This project demonstrates the utility of field data in informing empirical tests of the interactions between ecologically-relevant thermal dynamics and developmental processes to reveal the fundamental mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity as it occurs in nature.",Standard (12 minutes),In progress,Physiology;Conservation;,Schedule my presentation,,Done;,,,11/27/18 21:37,11/27/18 21:52,mdh72859@uga.edu,Matthew Hale,Matthew Hale,Doctoral student,"Odum School of Ecology, University of Georgia;Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, University of Georgia;",Jessica A.

Investigations into a population of alligators inhabiting a contaminated system in Florida, Lake Apopka, have uncovered the roots for some of these abnormalities in altered estrogen signaling during development, including shifts in ovarian function and transcription that persist into later life stages. Using a model in which juvenile alligators, collected as eggs from Lake Apopka and a reference site, were raised under identical laboratory conditions and challenged with either a vehicle control or a gonadotropin hormone (FSH) that stimulates ovarian function, we employed a non-biased RNAseq-based method to probe the depth and etiology of population-level differences in ovarian function associated with contaminant exposure. After identifying core transcriptional networks shared between populations, including FSH-responsive genes involved in steroid hormone production, cell proliferation, and oocyte development, we uncovered a cohort of responsive genes unique to each site that are putatively linked to contaminant exposure. Furthermore, in the non-challenged ovary, we identified an unexpectedly large proportion (~40%) of transcripts that differ across populations, suggesting that FSH challenge might ameliorate some degree of functional differences between populations. Collectively, these findings indicate a substantial role for developmental contaminant exposure in shaping future ovarian function.

We conducted a systematic literature review of virus survival using PRISMA methods, identifying papers that experimentally tested viral decay. From each study, we extracted viral species, laboratory methods, abiotic variables, publication theme, and persistence metrics. We identified 297 studies on 85 species from 25 viral families that fit our criteria. Studies are dominated by enteric viruses in the Picornaviridae family (36%). Most studies test temperature (60%) or pH (46%) effects rather than decay changes due to humidity (4%). For the most part, metrics for both viral quantification and viral persistence are widely variable and make comparative analyses difficult. We conducted meta-analyses of viral half-life on a subset of 88 studies of human viruses. Half-life ranged from less than an hour to three weeks, with an average of 65 hours across viral families. Relevant variables included viral composition and transmission pathway, along with environmental conditions.

Human cases were no longer clearly associated with each other and genetically related cases began to become far more common in domestic dogs, suggesting a canine origin to many cases. This new host threatens the viability of eradication efforts, making an understanding of the factors driving infection in dogs essential to this mission. To this end we ask what demographic, geographic, or climatic factors are most predictive of \textit{D. medinensis} infection in a villageês dog population. To address this question we used boosted regression tree models to identify covariates of importance for prediction of 4 distinct representations of \textit{D. medinensis} infection in a villageês domestic dog population. We find that local measures of infection such as presence of infection in a village are mostly predicted by demographic (e.g. prevalence of fishing) and geographic factors (e.g. standard deviation in elevation). Regional measures of infection such as presence of a village in a spatial hotspot are mostly predicted by climatic factors (e.g. precipitation of the warmest quarter).

This study reared three populations of \textit{Aedes aegypti} larvae through adult emergence, mating, and bloodfeeding at different temperatures. The three rearing temperature treatments were 32çC, 24çC, and 20çC with a 9 çC daily temperature fluctuation. Specimens were sampled as larvae, pupae, adults, and bloodfed females for 16S rRNA analysis to identify their respective microbial community compositions.

The daily pupation and emergence rates for all temperature treatments differed significantly. However, the differences between temperatures were not significant when accounting for only the total averages of pupation, emergence, and bloodfeeding. The results of the microbial analysis are pending. This impact on development times could have implications for population and disease dynamics; one potential effect may be a need for more larval habitat stability in cooler temperatures. There may be significant differences between these temperature treatments microbiomes, and future analysis will test this.

How primary producers affect basal metabolic regimes across biomes.,"Primary production provides a basal resource for food webs and is a key step in how carbon and nutrients cycle within or through an aquatic system. Prior studies indicate that differences in producer growth form determine the susceptibility of producers to hydrologic variability and thus shape the temporal and spatial structure of basal resources. Research also indicates that these growth forms exhibit differences in physiology that translate into distinct functional responses such as carbon fixation rates or uptake rates. In light of ever-increasing anthropogenic stressors, including but not limited to climate change, the resistance of particular growth forms to disturbance events could translate into more or less stable aquatic ecosystem function. My current research in the Middle Oconee River in Athens, GA indicates that the predominant macrophyte, \textit{Podostemum ceratophyllum}, provides resource stability during times of high flow. This particular species is structurally similar to a bryophyte and able to withstand high velocity waters.

Some commonly reported impacts of land use change have included alterations of the spatial distribution of vectors and host, and changes in vector and host community composition. However, the underlying mechanisms of these changes are not well understood. One potential driver may be the diversity of the vector gut microbiome. By focusing on how land use change impacts the microbiome, we can further study how the landscape can influence the transmission of vector-borne diseases, such as Chagas disease.	Chagas disease is caused by the parasite \textit{Trypanosoma cruzi} and spread via blood-feeding kissing bugs. Studies have shown that deforestation is associated with increases in kissing bug abundance and infection with \textit{T. cruzi} in the tropics, yet potential impacts of different land use types on microbial communities in kissing bug survivorship and parasite transmission is unknown.	 I will present my findings on the range of the whole-body microbiota found in sylvatic \textit{R. pallescens}, the primary vector of Chagas disease in Panama. Individuals were collected in two distinct regions in central Panama across a deforestation gradient and measured using 16s rRNA Illumina sequences. The two regions had significantly different infection rates and significant differences in alpha and beta microbial diversity. These results highlight patterns of microbial diversity which may be impacted by vector infection status and other environmental variables.

Furthermore, shrimp populations are inter-connected, as shrimp species across watersheds are genetically similar and form an island-wide metapopulation. El Yunque National Forest (EYNF), located in northeastern Puerto Rico, is likely a key source of larval shrimps to the metapopulation, given high shrimp densities and a lack of large dams. However, in the EYNF low-head dams paired with water intakes and drought can reduce instream flow and impact the export of shrimp larvae through reduced connectivity. Here we examine the cumulative effects of water withdrawals on habitat connectivity for migratory shrimp over a 37-year period across seven watersheds draining El Yunque National Forest. We calculated total habitat connectivity and refugia habitat connectivity (where refugia habitat is defined as predator-free upstream reaches above waterfalls >5 m) at a monthly time step using a habitat-weighted longitudinal riverine connectivity index. Findings indicate that total habitat connectivity declined slowly yet consistently over 37 years due to an increasing proportion of water withdrawn relative to stream discharge, which results in a reduced contribution of shrimp larvae to island metapopulation. Similarly, refugia habitat connectivity declined but at a slower rate. Our findings indicate the importance of minimizing water withdrawals from watersheds characterized by an abundance of refugia habitat. We also highlight the necessity of using a long-term (37 year) dataset and short time-step to fully understand the cumulative effects of multiple water intakes (associated with low-head dams) on habitat connectivity across several watersheds.

However, most laboratory studies are conducted at constant temperatures. Rate summation is a computational technique that can be used to infer the performance of traits in a fluctuating environment from performance at constant temperatures. Yet, rate summation has been shown to breakdown at the extreme ends of the thermal ranges for other ectothermic organisms. Thus, the accuracy of laboratory studies performed under constant temperatures in recapitulating transmission dynamics for mosquitoes under real-world temperature fluctuation is unknown. Individually-housed Anopheles stephensi were placed across five mean temperatures under both a constant and fluctuating temperature regime. We directly measured bite rate, mortality rate, and fecundity daily for each individually-housed mosquito across our temperature treatments.

While healthy hosts can invest microbially-derived energy toward growth, infection may force trade-offs in energy investment between self-maintenance and immune defense. We therefore examined the role of the gut microbiome in shaping such energy trade-offs in wild African buffalo exposed to bovine tuberculosis (\textit{Mycobacterium bovis}, BTB). Female buffalo were sampled in Kruger National Park, South Africa from 2009-2012 to assess BTB infection status, body condition, and circulating monocyte counts (a measure of BTB immune defense). Fecal samples were then processed for 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine whether relationships between gut microbiota and host physiology were consistent between BTB-infected and uninfected hosts. Only weak differences in microbial diversity were present between BTB-infected and uninfected individuals. However, associations between microbial composition and both body condition and monocyte counts were significantly altered by BTB infection. For example, key bacterial taxa that negatively co-varied with body condition in uninfected hosts were maintained at more constant levels in BTB-infected hosts, while the same taxa were positively associated with monocytes in infected hosts. These patterns suggest that the gut microbiome may help support investment in BTB immunity by mediating energy trade-offs during infection.

As omnivorous macroconsumers, freshwater crabs affect various trophic levels and may directly increase leaf breakdown by direct consumption and fragmentation, or decrease breakdown by consuming shredding insects. I used an enclosure experiment in a natural stream setting to quantify the effects of crabs on the rate of leaf breakdown and insect colonization of leaves. After 42 days of incubation, enclosures with crabs had faster rates of leaf breakdown (with crabs: k = -0.020; without crabs: k = -0.016; p < 0.05). In order to scale up the impact of crabs on leaf breakdown across headwater streams, I quantified crab densities across 20 headwater stream sites. Stream sites in undisturbed forested watersheds had higher crab densities than sites near human development. Anthropogenic pollution may decrease crab population densities and affect rates of leaf litter breakdown in tropical headwater streams.

In Georgia, USA, nests are threatened by predators including but not limited to: raccoons, feral hogs, armadillos, ghost crabs, snakes, and fire ants. Nesting beaches are patrolled daily at dawn, with surveys occurring below the previous nightês tide to ensure that all sea turtle emergences are detected. Daily patrols were conducted for the duration of Georgiaês sea turtle nesting season (15 May-1 October) in 2009-2018. The objective of this study was to examine a historical data set provided from beach monitoring efforts since 2009 and compare loggerhead nest losses due to different predators on two of Georgiaês barrier islands (Sapelo & Ossabaw Islands). We hypothesized that northern raccoons \textit{Procyon lotor} would be the most frequent predator of loggerhead nests, while invasive feral hogs \textit{Sus scrofa} would be responsible for the greatest mean egg loss per predation event. We also hypothesized that nine-banded armadillos (\textit[Dasypus novemcinctus]) and Atlantic ghost crabs \textit{Ocypode quadrata} would have a low predation effect compared to that of other predators. Our preliminary results show that raccoons have depredated an estimated 9714 eggs, while hogs have predated approximately 8617 eggs across the two islands. Egg losses from other predators were substantially lower: 1457 from ghost crabs, 310 from armadillos, 55 from birds, 17 from kingsnakes, 12 from fire ants, and five from possums.

However, there are multiple risks associated with surfacing in the winter including: 1) burning of fat stores; 2) difficulty escaping predators due to reduced performance ability; and 3) difficulty digesting prey items. It has been noted that surfacing during winter is related to temperature fluctuations and precipitation, yet, with the associated risks, observations of snakes surfacing during winter seem potentially maladaptive. Research has shown that snakes with challenged immune systems may prioritize reaching a higher body temperature at the expense of metabolic efficiency or risk exposure. Therefore, snake winter surfacing behavior may be related to infection and an effort to increase its metabolism to help fight infection. Here, I will present a model depicting expected body condition changes from wintertime surfacing among healthy and diseased snakes and compare model predictions to actual data from winter weight loss of eastern diamondback rattlesnakes (Crotalus adamanteus) on Jekyll Island, Georgia.

As a result, communities across the globe are turning to water recycling, the treatment of previously-used water followed by another use in the same geographic area. One of the main barriers to water recycling is public perception of risk. It is believed that with the implementation of state policies to direct the quality, liability, and oversight requirements for recycled water, it will increase the publicês confidence and willingness to use it. Through the investigation and summary of 14 state policy strategies, we identified the common components and made recommendations for future Georgia state policies. Recommendations included establishing clear legislative goals, assigning primary responsibility to the Georgia Environmental Protection Agency with input from the Georgia Department of Health, and requiring evaluation of the potential for recycling.

However, balancing ecological integrity alongside community values presents multiple and often conflicting objectives, which is one of the many challenges of managing and conserving small forests. A common ecological concern is the fate of the tree community itself, but the tools typically used to study tree dynamics are often developed for larger ecosystems, and they may not provide relevant information for small forest management. This study evaluates different forest dynamics models to assess their applicability to small forests, including models of individual species population dynamics, communities and succession through gap models, and ecosystem service production. For each model, I review spatial and temporal scales, levels of organization, and data requirements, from which I assess whether and how the use of each model would inform small forest management. Based on the type of information produced by each model, I also assess its usefulness in broader decision-making (DM) frameworks, such as structured decision-making, which are used to compare and optimize multiple management objectives.  This is particularly important when considering both the ecological integrity and social values of small forests. This literature review will hopefully provide small forest managers a convenient survey of available and appropriate models and DM frameworks, and the findings of this review will be used to select a model and DM framework to evaluate conservation and management options for maritime live oak forests on Jekyll Island.

The entrenchment of race as a concept did not occur in a vacuum but is juxtaposed with and reinforced by understandings of nature. From the early dominance of environmental determinism in naturalizing racial difference and justifying colonialism, to modern disparities in environmental amenities and burdens along racial lines, race and nature have long been entwined. Given that almost all ecosystems on Earth are affected in some ways by humans, ecologists can no longer ignore critical consideration of social systems and their impacts on the environment. In this talk I will briefly outline why ecologists need to be conscious of how the nature we study molds, and is molded by, understandings of race.

Thus, variation in resistance may mediate variation in the quality of secondary sexual displays. One mechanistic explanation of this relationship arises from the Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis (ICHH), which postulates that testosterone positively affects development of secondary sexual characteristics while simultaneously suppressing immunity, creating a trade-off between sexual signaling and vulnerability to infection. Though this has been supported across taxa, there are gaps in understanding what components of immunity are compromised, and the implications for organisms in pathogen-rich environments. This presentation will provide an overview of my proposed research which seeks to test the ICHH in a population of free-ranging American alligators (\textit{Alligator mississippiensis}) from Merritt Island in Florida. Males in this population have been shown to undergo seasonal fluctuations in testosterone levels that differ across a threshold of male body length; a trait correlated with dominance in the alligator mating system. Additionally, there were simultaneous fluctuations in levels of a testosterone precursor, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which has some support for being an immunostimulant. I hypothesize that DHEA may help mitigate the costs of testosterone. Using archival blood (plasma) samples, I will assess alligator immune responses to 6 different microbes to test relationships between testosterone, DHEA and immune function and evaluate the relative responses of males with different hormone profiles to pathogen exposure. This research will advance our understanding of how physiological trade-offs shape variation in pathogen vulnerability in natural populations.
